## Goal

First goal of our project is to let the agent to shoot a motionless target:

As the graph shown above, the target is standing right in front of us. Agent can only change it's up/down angle to aim at the mob.

Second goal of our project is to let the agent to shoot a moving-horizontally target:

More goals are coming!

## Environment setting
We're have two rectangle stages separated by a 2 block-length air gap, where Mob is standing on one stage, agent is facing the mob on the other. We chose Zombie as the Mob(target). Zombie has a 15 life long(3 shot). Time is set to sunset so that Zombie can still live. Peacons and Glowstone are used as our light resource.
