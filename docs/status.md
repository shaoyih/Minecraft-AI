## Project Summary
We trained our agents so that it can kill the Zombie using 3 arrows(3 arrows life).

## Approach
We used Reinforcement learning - Qtable

## Evaluation

## Remaining Goals and Challenges
<h3>Goal</h3>
Our goal for next phase is to shoot a zombie that is moving.
<h3>Challenges<h3>
<h4>Blood info<h4>
First and the biggest challenges we have during the implementation is find the life info of the Zombie(target), since we need it detect if we actually shot Zombie. While exploring the tutoring code, we find that we can actually get that info from <ObservationFromNearbyEntities>.
<h4>Make Zombie move continuously<h4>
In the creation mode, Zombie is rough moving 1 block per 5-10 seconds, which is too slow.
